# Discord-Nitro-Checker-And-Gen
A discord nitro generator and checker I made today

--HOW TO USE--
Run gen.py to generate codes, the more you generate the longer it takes and it will take up more space
To check the codes run checker.py, it will check all the codes in codes.txt (codes.txt becomes a file when you run gen.py)
