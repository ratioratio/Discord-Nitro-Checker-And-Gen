# Discord-Nitro-Checker-And-Gen
A discord nitro generator and checker I made today

--HOW TO USE--
Run gen.py to generate codes, the more you generate the longer it takes and it will take up more space
To check the codes run checker.py, it will check all the codes in codes.txt (codes.txt becomes a file when you run gen.py)

I will be adding webhook support in the future, its not the greatest right now because I made it in like 20min but it works  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
